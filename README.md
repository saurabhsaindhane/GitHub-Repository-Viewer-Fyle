The GitHub Repository Viewer is a web-based application designed to fetch and display public repositories of any GitHub user. Utilizing GitHub's REST API, this application allows users to search for a GitHub username and view detailed information, including the user's profile, bio, location, and a list of their public repositories.

Key Features:
- User Profile Display: Shows the GitHub user's profile picture, username, bio, location, and links (including their GitHub profile link).
- Repository Listing: Presents the repositories in a neat, two-column grid layout with details like the repository name, description, and the primary language used.
- Pagination: Implements server-side pagination, displaying a set number of repositories per page (configurable) for easy navigation.
- Responsive Design: Crafted with a responsive layout to ensure a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- No additional libraries: Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with an emphasis on simplicity and performance.

This project is perfect for anyone looking to integrate GitHub's REST API in their web applications or for those seeking a straightforward implementation of API data fetching and display. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
